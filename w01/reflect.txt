/*
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

From this workshop, I learned how to properly modularize my project. Previously, 
I used a single file to include all the code, which made organizing and maintaining 
my project difficult. I often got lost while working on relatively large projects. 
For example, during the OOP Milestone 3, even though the professor provided three 
modules, one source file contained over one thousand lines of code. Now, based on 
what I've just learned, I know I can add modules such as a utility module, a patient 
module, and an appointment module to organize my code better. In the utility module, 
I can place functions for sorting and finding. In the patient and appointment 
modules, I can focus on their specific code separately. Also, I would add namespaces 
(although not supported in C) in my future projects. From this workshop, I understand 
how I can categorize my code into different namespaces, which helps eliminate 
concerns over naming conflicts and visibility issues.
